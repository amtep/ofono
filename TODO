pBackground
==========

- Priority scale: High, Medium and Low

- Complexity scale: C1, C2, C4 and C8.  The complexity scale is exponential,
  with complexity 1 being the lowest complexity.  Complexity is a function
  of both task 'complexity' and task 'scope'.

  The general rule of thumb is that a complexity 1 task should take 1-2 weeks
  for a person very familiar with oFono codebase.  Higher complexity tasks
  require more time and have higher uncertainty.

  Higher complexity tasks should be refined into several lower complexity tasks
  once the task is better understood.


SMS
===

- Add support for Enhanced SMS (EMS) from 3GPP 23.040.  These SMS messages
  support a richer set of formatting elements, including bold/italic and
  font size selection.  Embedding images and sounds into the SMS is also
  supported.  This task should add support for receiving such SMS messages.

  Proposed solution is to convert such messages to HTML and embed image /
  sound data as embedded MIME in the generated HTML stream.  The EMS messages
  will have to be detected (by the presence of particular tags in the SMS)
  and signaled separately from simple SMS messages.

  Priority: Low
  Complexity: C8

- See / Cancel pending SMS messages over DBus.  When oFono sends SMS messages
  the method call is only returned when the message has been submitted to the
  network.  Instead we should return an object path and allow cancellation of
  pending messages.

  Priority: High
  Complexity: C2
  Owner: Yang Gu <yang.gu@intel.com>

- Persist outgoing SMS messages.  Currently oFono persists incoming messages
  that are fragmented.  However oFono does not persist queued outgoing
  messages.  oFono should persist such messages and restore / requeue them
  on the next oFono startup.

  Priority: High
  Complexity: C1
  Owner: Kristen Carlson Accardi <kristen@linux.intel.com>

- Add CDMA support to the SMS stack. The idea is to support only the PDU
  mode. To start with only Submit and Deliver message handling for WMT
  teleservice will be added to bring the basic CDMA SMS send and receive
  functionality.

  Priority: Low
  Complexity: C8
  Owner: Rajesh Kadhiravan Nagaiah <Rajesh.Nagaiah@elektrobit.com>

- Add CDMA Delivery(Status) Report handling to the SMS stack.

  Priority: Low
  Complexity: C4
  Owner: Rajesh Kadhiravan Nagaiah <Rajesh.Nagaiah@elektrobit.com>

- Add CDMA Voice Mail Notification handling to the SMS stack. In CDMA the
  Message Waiting indication is notified through a specific teleservice ID
  VMN. No update to corresponding elementary files required since they are
  not present in the R-UIM. This will result in the message waiting
  indication being initially processed within the SMS atom and then being
  passed for delivery to the message waiting atom. Furthemore note that in
  CDMA only voice mail type is supported.

  Priority: Low
  Complexity: C4
  Owner: Rajesh Kadhiravan Nagaiah <Rajesh.Nagaiah@elektrobit.com>

- Asynchronously acknowledge SMS DELIVER messages sent by the SMS driver
  to core using ofono_sms_deliver_notify().  This may require the struct
  ofono_sms_driver to be extended with one more function pointer like:
    void (*deliver_ack)(unsigned char *pdu, int len, cb_t cb, void *data)
  because currently messages are automatically acknowledged by either the
  modem (this is the case of some AT modems) or the driver right after
  ofono_sms_deliver_notify() and a failure to deliver at an upper level is
  ignored.  The PDU can be an RP-ACK or RP-ERROR message with optional
  TP-User-Content element, for example if returned from USIM Data Download.

  Priority: Low
  Complexity: C2

SIM / SIM File system
=====================

- Read / Write EFcfis.  Call forwarding settings can be bootstrapped on the
  SIM for faster notification of the user that call forwarding is active.
  These settings are stored in EFcfis.  oFono should read these settings and
  update the call forwarding atom appropriately.

  Priority: Low
  Complexity: C2
  Owner: Jeevaka Badrappan <jeevaka.badrappan@elektrobit.com>

- SIM Call History plugin.  New UICCs support four new SIM elementary files
  for storing call history information on the SIM: EFici, EFict, EFoci, EFoct.
  A plugin should be developed for oFono that will write to these files.

  Priority: Low
  Complexity: C2

- Support proprietary extensions for SIM PIN retry counter.  Most vendors
  provide an extension commands to obtain such a retry counter for PINs and
  PUKs.  Need to enable this as a property in oFono.

  Priority: Low
  Complexity: C2

- Add support for SIM 'ready' notifications from the driver to the core.  Most
  modem manufacturers initialize the SIM (e.g. cache SIM file system, STK
  initialization, etc) internally before allowing the telephony stack to
  access these portions.  When the PIN is locked, this can lead to oFono being
  too fast for the modem and asking it for things before the firmware is ready.

  The proposal is to introduce a new sim function:
    void ofono_sim_ready_notify(struct ofono_sim *sim);

  When oFono determines the SIM PIN is READY, it checks whether
  ofono_sim_ready_notify has been called.  If it hasn't, then it stalls the
  initialization procedure (and calling post_sim) until
  ofono_sim_ready_notify is called.

  Priority: High
  Complexity: C2
  Owner: Pekka Pessi <pekka.pessi@nokia.com>

- Check SIM pin status if sim_change_pin fails. If it is anything other than
  READY, we must tear the state back to pre_sim state and set the modem offline.

Modem Emulator
==============

- Support HFP AG emulator.  We should provide a new HFP_AG_EMULATOR atom type
  that will implement the Bluetooth HFP AG profile.  Voicecall atom, netreg
  atoms can register command handlers for this atom appropriately.

  Complexity: C4
  Priority: Medium

- Support extensions to HFP AG emulator.  Some carkits support additional
  AT command extensions to the Bluetooth HFP AG standard.  Refer to CE4A
  white paper: "AT-commands for Automotive Premium Phone Integration".
  Plugins can register additional command handlers appropriately to handle
  such commands.

  Complexity: C4
  Priority: Medium
  Depends: HFP AG emulator

- Support HSP AG.  Similar to HFP AG emulator but implements the much reduced
  Bluetooth HSP AG profile.

  Priority: Low

Flight Mode
===========

- Flight Mode support.  Add an 'Online' property to the Modem interface that
  will control the online state of the modem.  When Online state is True all
  atoms are available.  When Online state is False, all network related items
  are removed (e.g. CallSettings) or enter into reduced functionality set
  where only the SIM is available (e.g. DataConnectionManager, SimManager, etc)

GPRS
====

- PPP Server support.  Extend GAtPPP to support PPP Server role, similarly to
  how existing GSM modems support PPP GPRS contexts.

  Priority: High
  Complexity: C2

- IPv6 CP support.  To support IPv6 based GPRS contexts via PPP, GAtPPP
  needs to be updated to support IPv6CP from RFC 2472.

  Priority: Low

- Add support for IPv6 GPRS contexts.

  Priority: Medium
  Complexity: C1


Location Services
=================

- Neighbor Cell Info.  Add dedicated atom, D-Bus API and atom driver(s) for
  Neighbor Cell information.

  This feature is not discussed in 27.007, thus manufacturer specific commands
  are required.

  Complexity: C4

  Complexity: C2
  Owner: Pekka Pessi <pekka.pessi@nokia.com>


Sim Toolkit
===========

- Support Refresh proactive command.  The specification defines 7 types
  of Refresh types:
	- NAA Initialization
	- NAA File Change Notification
	- NAA Initialization and File Change Notification
	- NAA Initialization and Full File Change Notification
	- UICC Reset
	- NAA Application Reset (2G only)
	- NAA Session Reset (3G only)

  The 'NAA Initialization' type will be ignored by oFono, it is assumed
  this is handled by the modem.

  For 'UICC Reset', 'NAA Application Reset' and 'NAA Session Reset' oFono
  will first check whether there are any calls or ussd operations active.
  If there are, the appropriate response will be sent (e.g. busy on call
  or screen busy terminal response.)  Otherwise a positive response will be
  sent to the driver.  In the case of a 'UICC Reset' the driver / modem
  can interpret this that it is safe to reset the UICC.

  Alternatively, the driver / modem can notify the core of the SIM removal
  / SIM insertion events without using the Refresh proactive command.  It
  is up to the driver / modem to perform a warm reset.  In particular, 3GPP
  31.111 mandates that any change to EFimsi is done by using 'UICC Reset',
  'NAA Application Reset' or 'NAA Session Reset'.  Please see 3GPP 31.111
  Section 6.4.7.1.

  Other types will be handled by oFono flushing the EF cache of the files
  affected (or the entire SIM cache in case of Full File Change Notifications)
  and re-reading the affected files.  Any properties derived from these
  Elementary Files will be updated and signaled using PropertyChanged.

  Priority: High

  Complexity: C2
  Owner: Andrzej Zaborowski <andrew.zaborowski@intel.com>

- Support Set Up Call proactive command.  If the UICC has indicated that
  the user should be informed, then the SimToolkitAgent will be called
  in order to request user's confirmation of the call setup.  If the user
  has confirmed, or if user's confirmation was not requested, oFono will
  setup the call and optionally inform the user.

- Support Language Notification proactive command.

  Priority: Medium
  Complexity: C1
  Owner: Jeevaka Badrappan <jeevaka.badrappan@elektrobit.com>

- Support Provide Local Information.  Whenever oFono receives a Provide Local
  Information proactive command, it should check the type of the information
  requested.  If the information is about the time/date or the language of the
  terminal, it should respond to the command with the appropriate terminal
  response.  Otherwise, it will respond with an error.

Emergency Calls
===============

- Modem Emergency mode.  Support network registration and online/offline
  mode during the emergency calls and related network activity (e.g.,
  network-initiated location request via supplementary service channel).

  Proposed solution is to introduce a new Emergency boolean property to the
  Modem D-Bus interface and new functions to modem interface:

  - ofono_modem_emergency_mode_inc()
  - ofono_modem_emergency_mode_dec()
  - ofono_modem_emergency_mode_get()
  - ofono_modem_add_emergency_mode_watch()
  - ofono_modem_remove_emergency_mode_watch()

  When emergency mode is requested, modem is set to online (if needed) and
  the watchers are notified. There can be multiple parties requesting
  emergency mode.  When all of them have completed the emergency-related
  operation and called ofono_modem_emergency_mode_dec(), modem is set to
  offline (if needed) and the watchers are again notified.

  Priority: High
  Complexity: C2

- Country / Operator specific emergency numbers.  Figure out how to support
  countries / operators with specific mandated emergency numbers which are
  not part of the standard emergency number list. This needs to be queried
  by the voicecall atom every time a new SIM is inserted.  The list is
  assumed to be managed by the modem.  If no such functionality is available,
  then the 3GPP mandated behavior is used.

  Priority: High
  Complexity: C2

- Network updating the emergency number list. Support the list of emergency
  numbers dynamically updated by the network.

  Priority: High
  Complexity: C2

- Extend the voicecall interface with a property indicating whether this call
  is an emergency call (essentially the CLI matches one of the numbers on the
  emergency calling codes list.)

Miscellaneous
=============

- Bluetooth SAP Client support.  The Telit UC864-G devices support Bluetooth
  SAP client mode.  This requires the use of a modem side-channel to read the
  APDU & CPDU data and send it to the remote phone device over Bluetooth RFCOMM
  channel.
